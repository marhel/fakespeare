# Fakespeare

I was asked to hold a presentation on the Scala programming language, and came up with this demo. 

It is a parser of the full-text of [online Shakespeare plays](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/index.html) and a simple Markov chain based generator of fake Shakespeare quotes. Hence "Fakespeare".

At the moment, the only way to see the fake quotes is executing the src/Experiment.sc worksheet.

## Build, test and run

The project can be built, tested and run via gradle 4, using

    gradle build
    gradle run
