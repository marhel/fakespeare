# Fakespeare

I was asked to hold a presentation on the Scala programming language, and came up with this demo. 

It is a parser of the full-text of [online Shakespeare plays](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/index.html) and a simple Markov chain based generator of fake Shakespeare quotes. Hence "Fakespeare"
