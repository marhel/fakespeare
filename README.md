# Fakespeare

I was asked to hold a presentation on the Scala programming language, and came up with this demo. 

It is a parser of the full-text of [online Shakespeare plays](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/index.html) and a simple Markov chain based generator of fake Shakespeare quotes. Hence "Fakespeare".

At the moment, the only way to see the fake quotes is executing the src/Experiment.sc worksheet.

## Build, test and run

The project can be built, tested and run via gradle 4, using

    gradle build
    gradle run

The main method expects the first argument to be the stating word, and the rest of the arguments to be slugs for the plays to be loaded (see PlayFetcher.fetchOnline to work out the slugs for other plays).
The arguments defaults to the equivalent of:

    gradle run -PappArgs='["THIS", "hamlet", "much_ado", "macbeth", "lear", "midsummer", "othello"]'

## Example Fakespeare sequence

The following are two sample 200-word runs starting with the word "THIS", based on a Markov chain built from 137963 words taken from the following plays:

* The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark (30508 words)
* Much Ado About Nothing (21189 words)
* The Tragedy of Macbeth (17035 words)
* King Lear (26178 words)
* A Midsummer Night's Dream (16565 words)
* Othello, the Moore of Venice (26488 words)
